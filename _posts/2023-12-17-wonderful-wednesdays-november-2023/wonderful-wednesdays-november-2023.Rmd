# Gatekeeping Procedure

Results are provided from a simulation of a phase III study in schizophrenia patients, investigating efficacy at 3 dose levels (Low, Medium, High) versus placebo. The study includes a primary endpoint and two key secondary endpoints. The study includes a total of 9 hypotheses, and multiplicity adjustments are required to control for type I error.

A description of the challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2023/2023-10-11).
