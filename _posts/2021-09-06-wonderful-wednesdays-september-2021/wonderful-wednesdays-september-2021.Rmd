  The goal of the challenge is to produce an explanatory graphics - Visually demonstrate that there is a dose response in glycemic control for Rx (the higher the dose the lower the variability) and that the Rx med and Rx high demonstrate better glycemic control that SOC and these attributes are sustained.

# Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data
Diabetes affects over 463 million people worldwide. Diabetes is a vascular disease that can lead to amputations, blindness, kidney failure and death. Managing patientsâ€™ glucose levels is key to managing their disease.

The CGM data allows us to approximate glucose levels every 5 minutes continuously throughout the day. Glucose values with low variability and within clinically relevant ranges of 72 and 140 mg/dL are considered to indicate good glycemic control. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2021/2021-08-11).
