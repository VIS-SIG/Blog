  The goal of the challenge is to produce an explanatory graphics - Visually demonstrate that there is a dose response in glycemic control for Rx (the higher the dose the lower the variability) and that the Rx med and Rx high demonstrate better glycemic control that SOC and these attributes are sustained.

# Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data
Diabetes affects over 463 million people worldwide. Diabetes is a vascular disease that can lead to amputations, blindness, kidney failure and death. Managing patientsâ€™ glucose levels is key to managing their disease.

The CGM data allows us to approximate glucose levels every 5 minutes continuously throughout the day. Glucose values with low variability and within clinically relevant ranges of 72 and 140 mg/dL are considered to indicate good glycemic control. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2021/2021-08-11).

## Example 1. Bar plot

![](./images/barplot - Lorenz Uhlmann.png)  
[high resolution image](./images/barplot - Lorenz Uhlmann.png)  

In this bar plot, the relatively complex data set is boiled down to a very simple visualization. The relative amount of time is plotted against the time, by the treatment group.

The panel liked its simplicity and that clutter has been avoided. Furthermore, the coloring is chosen in a sensible way. Grey is used for SOC whereas different shaded of green are used for the Rx treatments which increasing intensity with higher dose levels. The horizontal lines and the y-axis tick marks could have removed to make it even less cluttered, because the percentage is shown in each bar.

## Example 2. Dashboard Trelliscope

![](./images/CGM-trelliscope.png)

The app can be found [here](https://agstn.github.io/CGM/)  

This is a lot more than just a visualization. It is a very comprehensive tool to do an extensive exploratory analysis of the data.

In the first tab ("AGP") we see individual patient data including individual profile plots over time. This is very helpful if you want to focus on specific patients. In the visualizations the level of information increases from top to bottom. In the first row, we see a summary over all data for this patient. The next row shows a summary over all days. And the last rows provides the user with individual patient profile plots.

In the second tab ("MODEL RESULTS"), we see a visualization of model results to detect clusters in the CGM values. The goal was to detect differences between clusters in regards to the time spent in the standardized glycemic ranges. The visualization helps the user to easily understand the results.

The last tab ("OTHER METRICS") follows a similar idea as the second tab. The clustering can be done on other variables in a flexible way. This makes this a very powerful tool with many options.

The whole tool comes with a lot of explanations of the definitions used and with clickable references.

The panel thinks that this is just a great and very powerful app to do a thorough exploratory data analysis.

## Example 3. Patient profiles with quantiles

![](./images/cgm_plot_quantiles.png)  

[high resolution image](./images/cgm_plot_quantiles.png).

This visualization shows quantiles of profile plots at week 52 for the different treatment groups. The message becomes very obvious in is stated in the title: Increasing dose leads to improved glucose stability at week 52.

The quantiles are color coded and the grid line helps to understand the results. It marks the upper limit of good glycemic control. Furthermore, the order of the treatment groups is sensibly chosen (from top left to bottom right - from SOC to the highest dose).

## Example 4. Averaged patient profiles

![](./images/MAD-CGM - Mark Baillie.png)  

[high resolution image](./images/MAD-CGM - Mark Baillie.png)  

In this visualization, we see the averaged profile plots for the different treatment groups. It is a very clean visualization and the message becomes quite obvious.

The panel thought coloring could be improved (for example, by using the same color with increasing intensity for the Rx arms with increasing dose levels). Furthermore, it might be better to re-organize the plots: The time points could be next to each other and the groups on top of each other.

A very good idea is the x-axis labeling. Even without a label it becomes clear right away that the time is displayed, due to the format that is being used.

## Example 5. Profile plots with overlays

![](./images/scatterplot_cgm_v0_2 - Abi Williams.png)  
[high resolution image](./images/scatterplot_cgm_v0_2 - Abi Williams.png)  

This visualization follows a similar idea as the one above. Furthermore, the same ordering of the plots is used and therefore, the same idea of re-ordering them might apply. Another thing that could be improved is the order of the treatment arms (going from SOC to low - medium - high dose) and the coloring of the arms with increased intensity of the color for increased levels of dosing. (Grey is wisely chosen for SOC.)

The overlays make it easy to compare the different groups which is a very nice idea of visualizing this type of data.

## Example 6. Variability plot

![](./images/profile_plot.png)  
[high resolution image](./images/profile_plot.png)  

In this plot, the variability (represented by the standard deviation) is plotted over time and by treatment group. This is a very good idea to present the stability of the values.

The title is very nicely done. The first line provides already a very clear message. The second line uses a smaller font size and provides additional information. This plot is very clear and easy to read. Only the coloring could be chosen in a different way as already discussed above.

res$Value <- res$Value*100
res$val.t <- format(round(res$Value, 1), nsmall = 1)

# Create the plot:
