  When a new patient-reported outcome (PRO) is developed, there is interest in deriving the following, to support interpretation of data collected using the new tool: Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) / Responder Definition (RD), Meaningful Between-Group Difference, Meaningful Score Categories. These are usually derived by using an existing, validated measure as the ‘gold standard’ to quantify e.g. disease status.

# Responder definition
When a new patient-reported outcome (PRO) is developed, there is interest in deriving the following, to support interpretation of data collected using the new tool: Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) / Responder Definition (RD), Meaningful Between-Group Difference, Meaningful Score Categories. These are usually derived by using an existing, validated measure as the ‘gold standard’ to quantify e.g. disease status.

Challenge: Use visualisations to support in the derivation in any or all of the following:

- MCID
- Meaningful between-group difference
- Meaningful score categories


A description of the challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2024/2024-07-10).
