  Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels, in many cases caused by
  the body’s immune system attacking healthy blood vessels, causing them to
  become swollen and narrow. The symptoms associated with vasculitis are varied,
  and include asthma, allergic rhinitis (cold-like symptoms), fever, joint pain,
  tiredness, loss of appetite and weight loss. In serious cases, if left
  untreated, severe vasculitis can lead to organ failure and death. Vasculitis
  is treated primarily with oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment. However
  long-term usage of OCS therapy at high doses is associated with a number of
  side-effects which worsen over time, and steroid-dependency is often a
  concern, so steroid doses need to be reduced if possible. However, some
  patients have a propensity to relapse, in which the patient experiences an
  acute flare-up of symptoms, usually requiring immediate treatment with high
  dose OCS treatment. Patients are considered to be in remission if the symptom
  score is zero concurrently with the OCS dose being ≤ 7.5 mg/day.

# Vasculitis Data
This is a study of a new investigational medicine for the treatment of a rare
type of vasculitis, with patients randomised to active treatment or placebo,
with an on-treatment period of 52 weeks and a subsequent off-treatment follow-up
period of up for 8 weeks. An ideal medicine would reduce vasculitis symptoms
and/or enable a reduction in OCS dose and/or reduce the risk of relapse.
Additional endpoints are defined for total number of days the patient was in
remission during the on-treatment period, and a binary endpoint for whether a
patients achieved remission within the first 24 weeks and maintained in
remission until the end of the on-treatment period. Being a rare disease, there
is no established consensus on a single endpoint for demonstrating efficacy.

## Example 1. Kaplan-Meier plot

This Kaplan-Meier plot goes straight to the point and provides a picture of the
data. Moreover, the chart makes viewers ask about the factor driving the
difference between placebo and treatment. In terms of design, some panelists
indicated that a way to improve it would have been to include the legend labels
close to the lines. That implementation would have helped to highlight the
connection between the colors and data.

The informative title produced a bit of a discussion. A panelist asked the
audience where is the line between describing the result and having a
promotional title. Another member mentioned the importance of knowing the
context where the chart will appear. Is it a poster? A Conference? A scientific
journal?

## Example 2. Lasagna plot

Similar to a lasagna plot or heatmap, this chart shows timelines of the patients
achieving remissions. The sorting is very helpful for identifying when they
started their remission, a message also supported by the title. Some panelists
wondered how the chart would look like with a different type of sorting, such as
the length to achieve remission. Others asked about relapses, which is something
that didn't appear in the plot.

Some of the suggestions mentioned were around legends and annotations. It would
have helped to have information about the circles or annotations that clarified
the meaning of the dots without lines in the placebo facet. Another
recommendation was to change the units of the X-axis to more relevant
measurements, such as years or months.

## Example 3. Visualisation app

The app can be found [here](https://agstn.github.io/VAS/).  

In this session, the Webinar had a special guest as part of the panel: Agustin
Calatroni, a regular contributor of the Wonderful Wednesdays. The members took
the opportunity to ask him about his entry, his work process, and how he started
learning R. His entry for this challenge was an R Shiny App that included
different filtering and sorting options. His app allowed viewers to see when
patients entered in remission or relapse, and also the reasons for those events.
In summary, the app brought up many ways of interacting, exploring, and
visualizing the data.

Asked about how he builds his apps, Calatroni stated that he always designs his
apps to organize the information from general to particular views, or
vice-versa. He also tries to provide as many answers for his stakeholders as
possible. This is why he always includes a table for them in all his
applications.
