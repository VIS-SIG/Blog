  Benefit-Risk Assessment: For a drug to be approved for marketing, regulatory authorities must determine that the drug is effective and that its expected benefits outweigh its potential risks to patients. An Alzheimer’s Disease drug might have a positive benefit-risk profile for lowering blood pressure. To generate a hypothesis, an exploratory benefit-risk assessment will be conducted.

# Benefit-Risk Assessment

For a drug to be approved for marketing, regulatory authorities must determine that the drug is effective and that its expected benefits outweigh its potential risks to patients. An Alzheimer’s Disease drug might have a positive benefit-risk profile for lowering blood pressure. To generate a hypothesis, an exploratory benefit-risk assessment will be conducted.
