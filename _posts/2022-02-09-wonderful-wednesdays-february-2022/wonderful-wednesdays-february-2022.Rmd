  The current example is focusing on uncertainty in study planning. In this Wonderful Wednesday Webinar, we assume that a phase III cardiovascular superiority study is planned and we will discuss how uncertainty can be displayed with regard to total study duration if the assumptions are not exactly met.

# Uncertainty in study planning
A phase III cardiovascular superiority study is planned with the following assumptions (simplified, no lost-to-FU, no treatment discontinuation, no non-CV death):

* Hazard rate of active comparator 5% per year
* Hazard ratio 0.775
* Accrual time 24 months, total duration 30 months

**Statistical settings:**

- Logrank test for superiority in time to first MACE event (CV death, MI,
stroke) Alpha 5%, Power 90%
- A sample size of about 9900 patients would be needed aiming for 650 patients
experiencing a MACE event to show superiority of the new treatment over the
comparator in reducing MACE events.
- The challenge is about how uncertainty can be displayed with regard to total
study duration if the assumptions are not exactly met, i.e. comparator hazard
rate between 4% and 6% (and hazard ratio between 0.75 and 0.8).

## Example 1. Animated dotplot

[high resolution image](./images/animated_dotplot.gif)  

This animated dot-plot shows the dependency between study duration and treatment
effect. The chart also shows how these two variables change when the study
assumption varies. In this way, this entry works well as a conceptual chart as
it is very good at representing uncertainty to not statisticians.

The panel spoke about how the plot efficiently communicates a general picture
and the difficulty of using gifs for conveying specific numbers. One of the ways
to overcome this challenge would have been to create an RShiny App where a
button play/pause or a slider controls the animation and, therefore, the data
displayed.

Regarding the aesthetics of the chart, the panel mentioned that increasing the
contrast between the background and the dots would drag the viewer's attention
even more to the central topic of the plot. One way to do so would have been by
swapping the grid color - having the background in white and grey lines.

## Example 2. Animated dotplot - Update to RShiny App

One of the panelists, Rhys Warham, remade the graph to include the ability to
stopping the animation. By adding this option, the project becomes a more
exploratory tool.

## Example 3. Linked heatmaps

Heatmaps are graphs that represent the strength of a relationship between two
categories of data through shades of color. In this case, the visualization has
three heatmaps:

- One represents accural time vs. follow-up time. The color of the cells shows
the sum of these two variables, which is the total time of a study.
- The second matrix maps Hazard ratio vs. Hazard rate, and the color represents
the Sample Size.
- Finally, the third matrix maps also Hazard ratio vs. Hazard rate and colors
the cells by Power.

The interactivity of the project brings real value to the graphs. The user can
hover over the cells to get specific information -very useful when using color
to map variables- and can click on them to see how the other charts are updated
depending on the selection.

There're also sliders in each of the plots to tighten the selectors and
increase the contrast between the cells of each of the heatmaps. 

The panel discussed the selection of color palettes for the charts, as they 
are easy to read and understand. They were questions about the divergent color 
palette of the first matrix: green and red tend to indicate good and bad values. 

Regarding the interactivity, two ways to improve the app would have been to 
add the variable names to the tooltips instead of mentioning "row" and "column",
and also highlighting the selected cell after clicking.

## Example 2. Animated dotplot - Update to RShiny App

The following code needs this [data file](./code/dur_dat)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

ref_dat <- dur_dat %>% dplyr::filter(baseline_haz == 0.05) %>%
  rename(ref_HR = HR)

makeplot <- function(df = dur_dat, basehaz){
  
  dur_dat2 <- dur_dat %>% dplyr::filter(baseline_haz == basehaz)
  
  plot<- ggplot(dur_dat2, aes(HR, optim_dur, size = required_events)) +
    geom_point(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.9, colour = "pink") +
    geom_point(data = ref_dat, aes(ref_HR, optim_dur),
               alpha = 0.4, colour = "blue", fill = "white") + 
    guides(size = guide_legend("Required\n failures")) +
    ylab("Total study duration (months)") +
    xlab("HR") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0.775, colour = "green") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 30, colour = "green") +

    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.border = element_blank())
  
  return(plot)
