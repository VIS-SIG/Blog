title: "Wonderful Wednesdays June 2024"
description: |
  The data set is based on a platform trial design. How can we best show the effect of sample size on the power/type 1 error? Does sample size affect PTP and Disj_Power in the same way? How about in interaction with the type of data sharing? What is the relationship between number of cohorts, cohort inclusion rate and power? How can we investigate the effectiveness of early stopping for futility? What is the relationship between the quality of the surrogate endpoint and the average number of patients enrolled? Is there an interaction with futility stopping and treatment effect scenario? How do FWER and FWER_BA differ from each other with respect to treatment effect scenario and maximum number of cohorts? Can you find other interesting patterns in the data?

# Platform Trial Design I

It is known that sometimes at the design stage of a clinical trial, simulations are conducted to better understand the operating characteristics of the design. In a [recently published paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9304586/), a simulation study was conducted for a platform trial design in the context of NASH (Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis). Different assumptions regarding e.g. treatment effect and correlation between the surrogate interim endpoint and the final endpoint, as well as design choices such as sample size and maximum number of cohorts allowed in the platform were investigated.

A description of the challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2024/2024-05-08).  
A recording of the session can be found [here](https://psiweb.org/vod/item/psi-vissig-wonderful-wednesday-51-platform-trial-design-i).

### Simulation setup (default) ###

# Maximumnumberofcohorts (7) : Max number of cohorts allowed to enter the platform
# CohortInclusionRate (0.03) : Rate at which new cohorts enter the platform (higher levels indicate faster entry)
# TreatmentEfficacySetting (1) " Treatment effect scenario
# FinalCohortSampleSize (500)
# TypeofDataSharing : How is data shared across cohorts
# InterimFutilityStopping :  Binding early futility stopping yes/no

### Other variables ###

# ShortTermEndpointQuality : Correlation between surrogate interim and final endpoint

### Output (operating characteristics) ###

# PTP : per cohort power
# PTT1ER : per cohort type I error
# FWER 
# FWER_BA : ignores sims where only efficacious cohorts
# FDR : false discovery rate
# Disj_Power : disjoint power
# Disj_Power_BA : ignores sims where no efficacious cohorts 

### Other output
# Avg_Pat = Average number of participants enrolled in the trial
