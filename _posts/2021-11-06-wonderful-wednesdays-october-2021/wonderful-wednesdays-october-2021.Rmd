# Competing risk example data set
Observational, multicenter cohort study, in adult patients with PCR-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to one of five collaborating hospitals in the region of Gelderland and North-Brabant (NL) for at least 24 hours between March and May 2020.

Recovery is considered a competing risk for mortality and is taken into account as an extra outcome.

Cumulative incidence curves were presented side by side for different characteristics.

The goal was to find a way to visualize the impact of different risk factors (comorbidities and symptoms at admission to hospital) on the risk of death considering the competing risk of recovery.
