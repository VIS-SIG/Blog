    "description": "Abi Williams presented data visualisations on co-occurrence of adverse events. How to display events that occur at the same time in the same patient and highlight differences of treatment or gender? A variety of very different approaches was discussed. The first visualisation was a heatmap for the frequency of co-occurrences. A Lollipop plot combined the frequency with the overlap time. Then a Shiny App made interactive exploration of up to 4 co-occurring events possible. The presentation of an UpSet plot brought up a discussion on the advantages over the vinn diagram. The shiny app AdEPro was referred to as an useful exploration tool for adverse event in general. Another tool for exploring the co-occurrence in particular was the force directed network graph. The final approach was embedded in a PowerBI Dashboard.",

Although the example data set was from a two-arm study and relatively simple, the display of type of AE, frequency, timing, severity and seriousness is not easily combined in one plot.",

    "description": "In this month’s webinar, we discussed an exacerbation example data set. The data is based on the RISE study for patients with moderate COPD. The primary endpoint is the number of exacerbations during a six month treatment period. Event data – but patients can (and do) have multiple exacerbations. Statistical analysis used a Negative Binomial model. The dataset also included other variables which (may) effect the exacerbation rate: % Predicted Normal of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Exacerbations in previous year, and Region / Gender. The challenge was to produce a data visualisation incorporating the information on the number of exacerbations observed. The discussed visualisations included a straightforward and clear presentation of the number of exacerbations, a Power BI app, longitudinal plots, and a display of patient-level outcomes.",

    "description": "This month's challenge was to summarise changes in haemoglobin (Hgb) concentration over time in patients with anaemia associated with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). An experimental medicine was compared with a control group, but in addition to demonstrating efficacy, there was a special interest in visualising intra-individual variability, as large changes in Hgb are a potential safety concern. The visualisations presented ranged from grouped line plots over time, Sankey-diagrams and line plots with quantile bands for summary views and a lasagna plot for the display of individual data. Some general hints were given on how to define suitable color palettes for graphs depending on the type of data. Presented by Steve Mallett.",

These examples nicely demonstrate that different displays support different purposes. Some visualizations are telling a story about the data and others help to explore the data.

We talk about what the SIG members like about each plot and give some pointers on areas we think could be improved. More specifically, we talk about: the value of a title with conclusions, the use of colour, the benefits of animation to display time, ways to declutter your graph and examples of clean design, enclosure to highlight important parts of the data, the benefits of the sankey diagram, how different charts help to answer different questions, and many more aspects of great visualizations.",
