    "description": "Satisfaction data example. The example dataset for this month's webinar was based on a survey of overall satisfaction performed in Germany in 2014. The primary endpoint was overall satisfaction with life. The question posed to the participants was: \"How would you rate your satisfaction with your life overall on a scale from 0-10?\", where 10 means completely satisfied. There was only one observation per participant and no treatment groups, as no treatment was administered.",

The primary outcome was progression free survival and we wanted you to explore different ways of visualising this time-to-event outcome. The dataset contained information that allowed you to explore subgroups, patterns of events and individual patient profiles.",
