The primary outcome in the trial was mean HbA1c at 6 months, and adverse events (AEs) were monitored and collected for the entire course of the study.",

Although the example data set was from a two-arm study and relatively simple, the display of type of AE, frequency, timing, severity and seriousness is not easily combined in one plot.",

The question posed to the participants was: \"How would you rate your satisfaction with your life overall on a scale from 0-10?\", where 10 means completely satisfied. There was only one observation per participant and no treatment groups, as no treatment was administered.",
