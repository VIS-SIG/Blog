Interactive Kaplan Meier

- Overall, this app produces a standard Kaplan Meier curve and associated data table 
- The app contains two tabs:
    - "KM Plot with number of patients"
	- This tab displays a standard plot and data table. The options in the left hand bar allow for updates to the chart in real time.
	- the data table is colour coded to match the legend in the chart
	- Labels not presented on the Y-axis so that the chart and the table align
    - "KM Plots to compare between subgroups"
	- two plots are displayed vertically
	- use options on the left hand panel to compare information between different scenarios
	- future improvements include:
		- Displaying N at start of treatment on the chart for the selected scenarios
		- adding a "hover" to indicate the N remaining at each timepoint for the selected scenarios
