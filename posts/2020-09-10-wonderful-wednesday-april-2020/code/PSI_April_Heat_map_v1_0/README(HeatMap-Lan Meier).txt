HeatMap-Lan Meier

- The HeatMap-Lan Meier uses survival functions from a Kaplan Mier curve to show the transition in the proportion of events. 
- The benefit of the KM information in this format is that it "separates" the curves while supplying the same information. Overlaps which obsure data are now not an issue
- The "proportion" with events is not as intuitive using a colour coded heat map. As such we have included a hover function. 
    - Placing the mouse over any element of the chart will show the survival function for all treatment arms.
    - The treatment arm and associated survival function in _BOLD_ represent the most favourable condition at the selected timepoint.
